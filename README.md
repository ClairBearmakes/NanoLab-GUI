### About
This is the code for the software and firmware of the Universal NanoLab; a small living experiment box that can go on the ISS or in a classroom.

This project was done at Warren Tech North in the years 2024-25. The GUI was made by Asher Powell and the Arduino firmware was coded by Clair Winkler. 
We worked with the team that designed the hardware of the Universal NanoLab (Amelia Brown, Miles Marcuson, and William Rager-Van Noy).
